# NRC Micro Mouse Robot (WIP)
### iSTEM Geauga ECHS - Simon Richard and Alex Schreoder

This is the code base for iSTEM's Micro Mouse robot for NRC 2021. It is being written in MicroPython for the Raspberry Pi Pico micro controller. We initially wrote this in C++ for the Teensy 4.0, but we recently decided to switch over to the RPi Pico.

**TODO:** Add schematic.
